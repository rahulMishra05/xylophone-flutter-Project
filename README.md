In this project we mhad created an xylophone app, which will play sounds of xylophone.

First we had imported an package from the officail website of Dart packages https://pub.dev/. From here we had impotred an package which will alow us to play audio files, name of the package is "audioplayer" https://pub.dev/packages/audioplayer#-readme-tab-.

By installing this package to our flutter project we add seven different audio files which contains different sounds of xylophone.
